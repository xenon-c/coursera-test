            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most clients have no idea what they want in a website</li>
                <li>It's YOUR JOB to ask questions to figure it out</li>
                <li>Bring website examples of similar businesses</li>
                <li>Encourage client to follow the rule of LESS (info) IS MORE - if everything's important, nothing's important
                    <ul><li>Encourage client not to cram info on the site</li>
                    <li>Help client identify the most crucial information and place it</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Find a way for the client ot INVEST in the project
                    <ul><li>Especially true if you're doing this for free just to build up your portfolio</li>
                    <li>E.g. have them commit to pay for product photography</li>
                    <li>E.g. have them provide product for demo etc</li>
                    <li>Have them spend something (at least a bit of an investment) so they take it more seriously</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Have client designated ONE PERSON responsible for decisions</li>
                <li>Limit number of revisions UPFRONT (have them sign number of revisions you're willing to make)
                    <ul><li>If it's a paying job, limit number of FREE revisions (E.g. up to 3 times free, then charge per hour)</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Google for "web development client questionnaire"</li>
                <li>Involve others if needed
                    <ul><li>E.g. contact a local college and see if a graphic design student wants to join you by providing free design services (same for other aspects e.g. photography)</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Get an idea of what the client has right now</li>
            </ul>
